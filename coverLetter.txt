Dear Sigmoid,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Junior Data Scientist (Entry Level) position as posted on Indeed.  Let me explain why I would have good potential to succeed in this training program and job.
 	The posting indicated that the intern will need to build relationships with clients and help them make analytics-driven decisions.  I have extensive experience designing tools that help connect individuals who do not code to their data.  I have created an R Shiny app, an interactive data science web app,
that identifies the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the 10 fold cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot. 
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/

	The intern is required to have a problem solving mindset.  I have led a group of 4 other SMU students in Kaggle's "House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to score in the 18th percentile using multivariate regression.  Throughout the competition, I focused on the problem: minimizing prediction error of the model.  I created 
a simple do-loop in SAS to iteratively calculate the prediction error (Root Mean Square Error) for every variable once it was added to the model.   This allowed our team to create the simplest model without using any boosting or gradient techniques which we did not learn yet.
 
		
	  
	I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
