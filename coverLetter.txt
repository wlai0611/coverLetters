Dear Alliant Health,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Data Analytics Intern position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about predictive modeling and data visualization and would love to work with your team.  Please let me explain how I am a great candidate.
 	One of the basic requirements is understanding of statistical methods, with programming experience in R or SAS preferred.
	 I have created an R Shiny app
that identifies the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the 10 fold cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot. 
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/

	The intern is required to have a background in predictive modeling and visualization in SAS.  I have led a group of 4 other SMU students in Kaggle's "House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to score in the 18th percentile using only multivariate regression techniques and 15 submissions.  We used SAS for our analyses and utilized PROC GLMSELECT's stepwise selection and PROC REG's diagnostic plots to select the best variables and address influential observations for our predictive model.  I created a do-loop in SAS to iteratively calculate the Root Mean Square Error for every variable once it was added to the model.   
	  
	Finally, my Bachelor's of Arts in Chemistry sparked my interest in drug disccovery.  I am fascinated by how the structure of chemical compounds can influence the body and their utility in curing diseases.  I want to make a difference and I feel Regeneron has a track record of helping those in need.  
	
	I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
