Dear Mobolutions,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Data Analyst position as posted on Indeed.  I would like to work here because I enjoy helping professionals generate insights from their data.  Let me explain why I am a good fit for this job.

	The intern is required to have working knowledge of data visualization tools.
I am a Tableau Desktop Certified Associate.  I have used Tableau to create a dashboard that identifies under-served markets for a fictional beer company using Level of Detail calculations, set and parameter actions.  I have deeply enjoyed connecting to many different data sources and easily exploring relationships.  The viz can be found here:

	  Furthermore, I have created a dashboard in RShiny, a web app created with R and Javascript, to help an analyst choose variables for a Naive Bayes classifier.  Action Buttons allow users to view the predictive performance of each variable if they were added to the model.  I used dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr and naiveBayes to produce this.  The app is here:

	The intern is required to have a working knowledge of Python as well.  I have previously worked as a Data Analyst at Brooklyn College's Cognitive Psychology Lab.  We used Python and R extensively for analyses of keyboard typing experiments.  I created a Python script that generates random paragraphs of text for a user to practice typing on using pandas, numpy and dictionaries on Spyder.  The script is available here:

	Furthermore as a data analyst, I used Microsoft SQL to create a database to store typing data from keyboard typing experiments in this RShiny web app:

Additionally, I passed Microsoft's Querying SQL Server 2012/2014 Exam with an 800/1000.
I am constantly trying to learn more about data management and am eager to relocate to join the team.

	I would love to work with you!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.

Walter Lai
