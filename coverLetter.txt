Dear Health One Alliance,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Alliant Health Plans Data Analytics Internship position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about predictive modeling, data visualization and health policy and would love to work with your team.  Please let me explain how I am a great candidate.
 	One of the basic requirements is understanding of statistical methods, with programming experience in R or SAS preferred.  I have created an R Shiny app that identifies the best variables to add to a multiple regression model that predicts the salaries of employees based on demographic features.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from the regression model.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable the app suggests potential explanatory variables that would improve salary prediction.  The app shows partial residual plots for new variables controlling for the current model's variables.

	As further proof of R proficiency and understanding of statistical methods,
I have created an R Shiny app that identifies the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the 10 fold cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot.

	The intern is required to have a background in predictive modeling and SAS.  I have led a group of 4 other SMU students in Kaggle's "House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to score in the 18th percentile using only multivariate regression techniques in SAS.  The competition challenged us to predict house prices based on any of the features of a dataset of houses.  We used SAS for our analyses and utilized PROC GLMSELECT's stepwise selection and PROC REG's diagnostic plots to select the best variables and address influential observations for our predictive model.  I created a do-loop in SAS to iteratively calculate the Root Mean Square Error for every variable once it was added to the model.   
	  
 	Regarding databases, I was a data analyst for 1 year at Brooklyn College's Cognitive Psychology Lab. I used Microsoft SQL to create a database to store typing data from a web app that helps users practice their typing:

The RShiny app connects to a Microsoft SQL database and authenticates or registers users and retrieves information on their prior typing sessions. 
Additionally, I passed Microsoft's Querying SQL Server 2012/2014 Exam with an 800/1000.
	
	I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
