Dear Warner Bros,
            My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the _ position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about RShiny and its ability to communicate statistics insights to a broad audience.  I was very excited to here about your internship posting and I will go over why I am a perfect fit for the role.
 
	The posting indicates that the intern is required to  in R.  I have created an R Shiny app 
that identifies the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot. 
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/

	The intern will also learn how to use various machine learning models such as random forest and will also run simulations to test specificity of models.  I have used decision trees in a school project to predict employee attrition, quitting jobs.  I used for loops and ggplot2 to estimate the optimal parameters to input into the decision tree to maximize both sensitivity and specificity.  
	
	The intern is required to use relational databases.  I have created a relational database using MS SQL to store data from an online typing web app.  The database stores the typing speed and accuracy of a user for each typing session.  The app authenticates users based on their username and ID.  Furthermore, I have passed Microsoft's Exam 70-461, Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014 which introduced me to MS SQL objects and optimization of SQL queries.    
	
	
	I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
