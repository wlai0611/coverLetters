Dear Vamonde,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Junior Data Scientist position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about predictive modeling and data visualization and would like to explain why I am the perfect fit for the role.

	The intern needs to have examples to show of applied machine learning in context.  I have created an R Shiny app to identify the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the 10 fold cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot.  
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/
I have also created an R Shiny app that visualizes the contributions that aids in variable selection for multivariate regression.

	The posting indicated a need for machine learning knowledge.  I have a solid understanding of predictive modeling.  I have led a group of 4 other SMU students in Kaggle's "House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to score in the top 18th percentile using multivariate regression techniques including partial residual plots and automatic variable selection: https://www.kaggle.com/walterlai

	The posting indicates that the intern is required to have programming knowledge in Python.  I have previously worked as a Data Analyst at Brooklyn College's Cognitive Psychology Lab.  We used Python and R extensively for analyses of keyboard typing experiments.  I created a Python script that generates random paragraphs of text for a user to practice typing on using pandas, numpy and dictionaries on Spyder.  The script is available here:
