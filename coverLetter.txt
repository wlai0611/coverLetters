Dear IBM,
            My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Junior Data Scientist Apprentice position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about predictive modeling and exploratory data analysis and I would love to build further on my skills to be an IBMer.  I was very excited to here about your apprenticeship posting and I will go over why I am a perfect fit for the role.
 
	The posting indicates that the intern is required to have programming knowledge in Python.  I have previously worked as a Data Analyst at Brooklyn College's Cognitive Psychology Lab.  We used Python and R extensively for analyses of keyboard typing experiments.  I created a Python script that generates random paragraphs of text for a user to practice typing on using pandas, numpy and dictionaries on Spyder.  The script is available here:

	In my Master's Program, I have learned the fundamentals of classification machine learning models.  I have created an R Shiny app 
that identifies the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot. 
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/
	
	I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
