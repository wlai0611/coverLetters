Dear Optimal Solutions Group,
        My name is Walter Lai, a student in the Master's of Data Science Program at Southern Methodist University.  Please consider this letter as my cover letter for the Data Scientist Junior position as posted on Indeed.  I am really passionate about predictive modeling and data visualization and would like to explain why I am the perfect fit for the role.

	The posting indicated a need for machine learning knowledge.  I have a solid understanding of predictive modeling.  I have led a group of 4 other SMU students in Kaggle's "House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to score in the top 18th percentile using multivariate regression techniques including partial residual plots and automatic variable selection: https://www.kaggle.com/walterlai

	Experience with data management and machine learning toolkits is required for the role.  As a data analyst for Brooklyn College's Cognitive Psychology Department for a year, I have used R's dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr and lm to produce plots, tables and statistical inferences for a research paper in the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327456467_Instance_theory_predicts_information_theory_Episodic_uncertainty_as_a_determinant_of_keystroke_dynamics

In the paper I performed a simple linear regression of subject's typing speeds against a linguist metric of the English language to explore the relationship between language structure and keyboard typing skill acquisition.

	The intern needs to have experience with data exploration.  I have created an R Shiny app to identify the best variables to add for a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether employees will quit their jobs.  Action buttons allow users to add and remove variables from a Naive Bayes classifier.  After each time a user adds or removes a variable, the app shows the 10 fold cross validated Sensitivity and Specificity of all other explanatory variables if they were added to the model in a dot plot.  
The app:  https://wlai0611.shinyapps.io/bayesshiny/
I also am a Tableau Desktop Certified Associate. 


	 I would love to join your team!  Please email me at walterlaicollege@gmail.com.
